# About Hope for Justice and Slave-Free Alliance

Hope for Justice is a charity working to bring freedom from human trafficking and modern slavery with an effective and proven multi-disciplinary model. Our programmes and training initiatives in the UK, USA, Ethiopia and Uganda reach just under 150,000 adults and children each year. Our wholly owned social enterprise, Slave-Free Alliance, provides services to companies and public bodies in countries including the UK, USA and Australia that are seeking to protect their operations and supply chains against the risks of modern slavery and labour exploitation.
