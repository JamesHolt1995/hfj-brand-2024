# Honouring

# Open

# Empowering

Our values act as guiding
principles for everything
we do. Theyâ€™re part of who
we are. They guide how
we act and underline what
really matter to us: the
combined values, belief
and personality of the
organisation. These values
spell the acronym HOPE.
Hope lets us see the light
despite the darkness and
keeps us focused on our
mission to bring freedom
from human trafficking
and modern slavery.
