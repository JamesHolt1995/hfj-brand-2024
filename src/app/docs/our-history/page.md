# Our History

We are proud that our
heritage is shared with
those organisations who
have joined together with
us: Natalie Grantâ€™s antitrafficking
organisation,
Abolition International
(formerly The Home
Foundation); Transitions
Global in Cambodia; Retrak
in Uganda and Ethiopia,
originally founded in the
1990s; Break the Cycle
200 in the USA; Lily Pad
Haven in the USA; and No
More Traffik in Northern
Ireland. All became part
of Hope for Justice.

Hope for Justice began in the UK
in 2008, when a small group of
people passionate about seeing an
end to modern slavery took
the step from outrage to action.
They brought together nearly
6,000 people at an event called
The Stand, growing a movement
and founding a charity dedicated
to helping the victims and
survivors of this terrible crime.
