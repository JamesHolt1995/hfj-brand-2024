# Together, we are bringing freedom from human trafficking and modern slavery by identifying victims, supporting survivors and preventing exploitation.

This is our mission
statement. We use our
mission statement as our
‘what’ and our ‘how’,
to explain how we work
towards our goal of bringing
freedom, what it will mean
in practice, and the steps we
are taking to get there. We
highlight that we are doing
this together: together
with victims and survivors,
together with partners and
collaborators, and together
as a movement for change.
