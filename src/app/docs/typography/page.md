# Hope for Justice Typography

Our typography has been selected to convey powerful, emotive messages while instiling a sense of authority.

{% type-examples type="fk" /%}

FK Screamer Legacy is a key element in our brand. It works to maintain consistency, create clarity, and provide a clear voice for the brand as a global leader in the fight against slavery. It has been chosen based on its activist style in order to maximize its impact across all applications while keeping it easy to read, ownable, and highly recognisable.

{% type-examples type="canela" /%}

Canela Medium has been chosen for its authority in delivering editorial style messages to the audience while providing a juxtaposition to the powerful bold characters of FK Screamer.

{% type-examples type="apercu" /%}

To complement both these typefaces and be agile across all platforms, Apercu was selected to be used for smaller applications such as sub-headers and body copy.
