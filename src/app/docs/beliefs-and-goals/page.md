# This is who we are:

These beliefs and goals
speak to the culture of
the organisation and
the way we go about
delivering on our mission.

1. **We want to live in a world
   free from slavery.**
2. **We believe freedom
   is worth the fight.**
3. **We believe justice is
   non-negotiable.**
4. **We refuse to abandon the
   least, the last and the lost.**
5. **We believe we can be
   the generation to end
   human trafficking.**
6. **We see a world where
   every person’s dignity
   is protected and no-one
   is for sale.**
7. **We believe that no one person can do
   everything, but we can all
   do something.**
8. **We believe everyone
   deserves to be free.**
9. **We believe that every
   person trapped in modern
   slavery is an emergency.**
10. **We believe that ending
    slavery requires hope,
    action and unity.**
