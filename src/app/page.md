# Bringing freedom from modern slavery

We use this ‘positioning
statement’ as our core
summary of ‘who we are and
what we do’. It explains why
we are in this fight and the
ambition at the heart of our
movement. It represents
why we do what we do, and
why we fight as hard as can,
and why we refuse to ever
give up.

## Reinforcing our Positioning Statement

We can reinforce
our positioning statement,
where space allows, with
this explanation of what
bringing freedom means
to Hope for Justice:

What does bringing freedom mean to us? It means people
living free from exploitation, and free from the fear of being
exploited. It means survivors having the power, agency and
opportunity to make choices about their own future, living
in dignity. It means safer communities in which vulnerability
to human trafficking is transformed into resilience. It means
improving the response, partnering with other agencies
and civil society, while standing with survivors to create
a world in which everyone can live free from slavery.
